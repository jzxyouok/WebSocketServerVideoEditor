This project is meant to take websocket clients and accept their commands for video file handling.
Uses google-gson version 2.2.2 http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/downloads/detail?name=google-gson-2.2.2-release.zip&can=1
and tootallnate's websocket framework https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket

Features:
* uses FFMPEG command line for all video file manipulation
* handles upload and download requests from client
* checks for cached video files before creating new file manipulations

Future features:
* chain all commands, which are created by recieved json objects
* all cached files will be in a hashed array
* add authenticated users and SSL support
